## About Rustlings

Rustlings is an open-source project developed by the Rust team. It provides small, focused exercises that teach Rust concepts such as:

- Variables and functions
- Ownership and borrowing
- Enums, structs, and pattern matching
- Vectors, strings, and hashmaps
- Traits, generics, and lifetimes
- Error handling
- Iterators and closures
- Smart pointers, threads, and macros
- Writing tests and using Clippy

Each exercise builds on the last, helping reinforce core ideas and idiomatic Rust code.
